My opinions are fully transparent and I aspire to include all opinions. My scores are only based on the reasons I have been told so far. I am gullible so I trust everything I am told until I have reasons not to. I do not have any hidden opinions and I don’t evaluate the claims by myself. You can always open a claim to see exactly how I score it. You can also change my opinion by providing reasons. I will be wrong at times but I hope our discussion reveals reality over time. 

## To keep my opinions transparent I follow these rules:

- I am gullible. I believe everything I am told. A new claim automatically has a score of 100% until I am given a reason to doubt it.
- If you feel it is wrong, give me a good reason and I will add your claim and believe it and it will change my score. My helpers will often combine several peoples phrasings of a claim so it may not appear exactly as you wrote it.
- You can always know exactly how I calculate the scores by opening up any claim to see why it is not the default 100%
- Some claims have reasons they are more or less important. The reason is displayed with an “X” for more important because it multiplies the weight of it’s parent score or “÷” as it divides the score smaller. This can cause some scores to go above 100%
